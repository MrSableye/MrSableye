I'm Mr. Sableye. I mostly work on Pokémon-related projects, but I sometimes branch out to some of my other hyperfixations as well.

My primary work here is on [Clovermon Showdown](https://clover.weedl.es), a [Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) fork for the [Pokémon Clover](https://poclo.net) ROM hack (and a few other hacks too!).

I work on some other tools  such as my precious child [Borygon](https://github.com/MrSableye/borygon), an alternative Pokémon Showdown client for bots and automation. As well as a couple of random tools related to the Pokémon TCG.

If not otherwise stated, all my code is freely available to use with proper credit given.
